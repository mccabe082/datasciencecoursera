# pre-analysis pre-registered objectives:

1. Fatalities
   1. look a total deaths and the breakdown between Direct & Indirect
   2. look for a correllation between deaths and injuries
   3. **find the incident with the highest total loss of life**
   4. **find the event type responsibile for the highest total loss of life**

2. Cost
   1. Look at the breakdown of total cost for each event type
   2. **find the incident with the highest total cost**
   4. **find the event type responsibile for the highest total cost**

3. Misc,
   1. Look for a correlation between Total Cost and Total Deaths



# post-analysis observations:

0. the situation is rich, complex - we can only gleam insights from data -**Accurately gauging the “deadliness” of a specific event type is problematic due to several reasons:**
      1. **Classification ambiguity** some phenomena exist on a continuum e.g., gustnado vs. tornado vs. waterspout and are not always consistently categorised. It’s possible that the severity or casualty count influences classification.
      2. Reporting bias:
         1. the deaths in some events go under-reported e.g. the 1995 chicago heatwave
         2. I supose some events involving no fatalities may go unreported
      3. the multivariate nature of fatilities - "deadliness" of each event is dependent on background/context - e.g. storms over a populace area as opposed to a remote or rural area.

1. Fatalities
   1. No data for direct vs indirect
   2. Strong positive correlation between injuries and deaths
   3. **Major fatal event types appear to be EXCESSIVE HEAT and TORNADO**. While these contribute the highest total fatalities, they are often not the most fatal per event — many such incidents result in no deaths, and a few outliers skew the totals. Other, less common event types show lower variance and are more deadly on average.
      1. For example, Excessive Heat is recorded when heat index values exceed local thresholds. These thresholds might vary - introducing inconsistencies across regions and time.
   4. The deadliest single recorded event appears to be the 1995 Chicago heatwave.
   
2. Cost
   1. We have property and crop damage - crop damage is neglegible relative to property damage
   2. The 2005 napa floods costliest ever however this might be due to a data entry error with hurricane Katrina being the second worst reported incident
   3. The flood event type is responsible for most costs
