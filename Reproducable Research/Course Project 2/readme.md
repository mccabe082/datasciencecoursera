# Introduction

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.


## General Question

which types of events are most harmful to population health?
which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

## Datascience Question

which types of events hqve produced the most reported fatalities overall and in laters years?
which types of events have the largest reported cost overall and in later years?

## Datascience Question (refined/needs clarification w/stakeholder)

which types of events hqve produced the most reported fatalities (sum of *direct*, *indirect* and *delayed*) overall and in laters years?
which instance led to the greatest reported fatalities - what type was it?
which types of events have the largest reported cost (*private* and *public*) overall and in later years?
